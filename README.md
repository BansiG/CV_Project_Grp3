Humans use their eyes and their brains to see and visually sense the world around them. Computer vision is the science that aims to give a similar, if not better, capability to a machine or computer.

Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.


Some of the Computer Vision application focused here are:

1. Face recognition using SIFT and HOG feature extractor with ANN, SVM, CNN and simple euclidean distance.

2. Obstacle detection and distance estimation to aid visually impaired people is implemented considering real time constraints and scenario.
